# Overview

I wrote this game as a project to learn about game development. The resources I used were a couple of youtube tutorials (a pong example tutorial,
debugging, signals, scripting, etc.) as well as the official Godot documentaion.

## Description:

A simple 2 player lazer hockey game. Hit the puck into the other player's goal to score.

## How to Play:

Use controls (WASD for player 1, and Arrow Keys for player 2) to move disc around the board.
| Controls: |Player 1 | Player 2    |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Up        | W       | Up Arrow    |
| Down      | S       | Down Arrow  |
| Right     | A       | Right Arrow |
| Left      | D       | Left Arrow  |
